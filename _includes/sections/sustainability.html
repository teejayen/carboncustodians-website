          <h2>Beyond the Linear Economy</h2>
          <p>The traditional take-make-dispose approach is rapidly reaching its limits. With resources becoming scarcer and waste volumes increasing, we need transformative solutions that reimagine waste as a valuable resource.</p>
          <p>Our pyrolysis technology is being developed as a key enabler of circular economy principles, transforming "end-of-life" materials into resources with long-term value while permanently sequestering carbon.</p>
          <p>This approach aligns with the emerging <a href="/about/industry-5-0/">Industry 5.0</a> framework, which recognizes waste prevention as central to creating a sustainable industrial future that works in harmony with natural systems.</p>

        <h3>Transforming Waste Into Legacy</h3>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 18px auto;">Our approach represents a fundamental shift from viewing materials as waste to seeing them as resources in transition. By creating permanent carbon solutions while generating valuable products, we're helping build a circular economy that ensures resources remain in productive use indefinitely.</p>
