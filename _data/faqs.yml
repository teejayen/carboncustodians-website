- question: What is biochar?
  answer: Biochar is a stable form of carbon created through the pyrolysis of organic materials in a low-oxygen environment. It's similar to charcoal but produced with the specific intention of being applied to soil as a carbon sequestration method and soil amendment.

- question: How does your pyrolysis technology differ from conventional methods?
  answer: Our technology uses flameless induction heating rather than direct combustion, providing precise temperature control and significantly higher energy efficiency. Our containerised mobile units can process wet biomass without pre-drying and operate as a completely self-sustaining system after startup.

- question: What feedstocks can be used to produce biochar?
  answer: Our system can process a wide variety of organic materials including agricultural waste, forestry residues, green waste, food processing byproducts, and many materials with high moisture content that traditional systems cannot handle efficiently.

- question: How long does biochar remain stable in soil?
  answer: Biochar is exceptionally stable, with most research indicating persistence in soil for hundreds to thousands of years. This makes it one of the most permanent forms of carbon sequestration available, creating a true climate legacy.

- question: What are the agricultural benefits of biochar?
  answer: Biochar significantly improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity. It can reduce fertilizer requirements, increase crop yields, improve drought resistance, and remediate contaminated soils while permanently sequestering carbon.

- question: How do carbon credits work with biochar production?
  answer: Each tonne of biochar permanently sequesters approximately 3.67 tonnes of COâ‚‚. This can be verified and certified through platforms like Puro.Earth to generate carbon removal credits that can be sold on voluntary carbon markets, creating an additional revenue stream.

- question: What is the energy balance of your pyrolysis system?
  answer: Our system requires an initial energy input for startup but becomes entirely self-sustaining afterward by capturing and utilizing process gases. The system actually produces excess energy that can be used for other purposes, creating a positive energy balance.

- question: What makes your containerised systems unique?
  answer: Our mobile units can be deployed directly to waste sources, eliminating transportation emissions. Each unit can process up to 5 tonnes per hour with zero external power requirements after startup, and includes sophisticated monitoring systems to ensure optimal production quality.

- question: What is wood vinegar and how is it used?
  answer: Wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid) is a byproduct of the pyrolysis process. It contains numerous organic compounds and can be used as a natural pesticide, plant growth enhancer, and animal feed supplement. Our system captures this valuable resource that would otherwise be lost.

- question: Do you sell or lease your pyrolysis equipment?
  answer: We primarily offer flexible leasing arrangements that include technical support, maintenance, and operational assistance. This allows organizations to implement our technology without large capital expenditures while ensuring optimal performance and output quality.
