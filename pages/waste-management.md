## Transforming Waste Management Challenges

Modern waste management faces unprecedented challenges: increasing volumes, complex waste streams, rising disposal costs, and stricter environmental regulations. Our containerized pyrolysis technology provides an innovative solution that transforms these challenges into opportunities.

## Specialized Solutions for Problem Materials

### Treated Timber Processing

Our technology addresses one of the waste industry's most challenging materials: treated timber. Research published in the *Journal of Hazardous Materials* demonstrates that our high-temperature pyrolysis approach:

- Effectively immobilizes up to 98% of copper, chromium, and arsenic from CCA-treated timber
- Destroys organic preservatives including creosote, pentachlorophenol, and ACQ
- Converts hazardous waste into a safe, valuable carbon product
- Eliminates leaching risks associated with landfill disposal
- Creates a solution for an estimated 5 million tonnes of treated timber waste produced annually in Australia

## Comprehensive Benefits for Waste Management Operations

Our containerized pyrolysis system offers waste management companies, councils, and recyclers multiple advantages:

<div class="stats-container">
  <div class="stat-item">
    <h3>50-80%</h3>
    <p>reduction in waste volume</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <h3>5 tonnes</h3>
    <p>processing capacity per hour</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <h3>3.67 tonnes</h3>

  </div>
  <div class="stat-item">
    <h3>24/7</h3>
    <p>operational capability</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Operational Advantages

- **Mobile Deployment**: Containerized units can be placed at transfer stations, landfills, or material recovery facilities
- **Modular Scaling**: Start with a single unit and add capacity as needed
- **Self-Sustaining Operation**: After startup, requires no external energy inputs
- **High Moisture Tolerance**: Process wet materials without extensive pre-drying
- **Minimal Footprint**: Each unit requires just 12m x 24m of space
- **Rapid Processing**: Transform waste into valuable products in under 40 minutes
- **Multiple Revenue Streams**: Generate income from carbon credits, biochar products, and tipping fees

  <h3>Potential Scenario: Regional Waste Management</h3>
  <p>Based on technical specifications and research data, a regional waste authority implementing our system could potentially achieve:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Significant reduction in landfill inputs from green waste and timber streams</li>
    <li>Substantial savings in landfill costs based on current tipping fees, and waste levies</li>
    <li>Potential generation of carbon credits through verified carbon removal</li>
    <li>Processing capability for treated timber that currently has limited recycling options</li>
    <li>Opportunity to develop local markets for biochar products</li>
    <li>Theoretical return on investment within 2-4 years depending on scale and local factors</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: This represents a projected scenario based on system specifications and has not yet been implemented at full scale. Actual results may vary based on specific conditions and implementation details.</p>
