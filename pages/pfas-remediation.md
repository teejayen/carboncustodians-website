## The PFAS Challenge

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent one of the most persistent and challenging environmental contaminants worldwide. These "forever chemicals" are found in firefighting foams, industrial processes, and consumer products, creating widespread soil and water contamination with serious human health implications.

## Our Integrated Hemp-Pyrolysis Solution

Carbon Custodians has developed a groundbreaking two-phase approach that combines hemp phytoremediation with high-temperature pyrolysis to provide a complete PFAS remediation cycle:

<div class="process-diagram">
  <div class="process-step">
    <div class="step-number">1</div>
    <h4>Hemp Phytoremediation</h4>
    <p>Industrial hemp is planted on PFAS-contaminated soil, leveraging its unique ability to extract and concentrate these compounds from soil and groundwater.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="process-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="process-step">
    <div class="step-number">2</div>
    <h4>Harvesting</h4>
    <p>PFAS-laden hemp biomass is harvested, removing contaminants from the environment and concentrating them in plant material.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="process-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="process-step">
    <div class="step-number">3</div>
    <h4>High-Temperature Pyrolysis</h4>
    <p>Our specialized pyrolysis process destroys PFAS compounds through high-temperature transformation (>800°C), breaking carbon-fluorine bonds.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="process-arrow">→</div>
  <div class="process-step">
    <div class="step-number">4</div>
    <h4>Safe End Products</h4>
    <p>Process creates biochar free from PFAS, which can be safely returned to soil for carbon sequestration and soil improvement.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Scientific Validation

<div class="two-column">
  <div>
    <h3>Hemp PFAS Extraction Capability</h3>
    <p>Research from the University of Newcastle demonstrated that industrial hemp can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extract up to 43% of PFOS and 45% of PFOA from moderately contaminated soils in a single growing season</li>
      <li>Concentrate PFAS primarily in above-ground biomass, facilitating complete removal</li>
      <li>Grow successfully in highly contaminated environments that inhibit other remediation crops</li>
      <li>Extract contaminants from soil depths of up to 60cm through its extensive root system</li>
    </ul>
    
    <blockquote>
      "Hemp demonstrates exceptional potential as a phytoremediation agent for PFAS compounds due to its rapid growth, extensive root system, and high biomass production."
      <cite>— Environmental Science & Technology, 2023</cite>

## Pyrolysis PFAS Destruction

Our specialized high-temperature pyrolysis process has been extensively tested and proven effective for PFAS destruction:

- **Complete Destruction**: Process temperatures >800°C effectively break the carbon-fluorine bonds that make PFAS persistent
- **Captured Byproducts**: All gaseous byproducts are captured and neutralized within a closed system
- **Verified Results**: Laboratory testing confirms >99.9% destruction of PFAS compounds
- **Compliance**: Final products meet Australian and international standards for PFAS-remediated materials

<div class="research-highlight">
  <h3>Research Highlight: PFAS Destruction Verification</h3>
  <p>A 2023 study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials tested our pyrolysis system on PFAS-contaminated biomass and found:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete destruction of PFAS compounds at temperatures above 800°C</li>
    <li>No detectable PFAS in resulting biochar (below 0.5 μg/kg detection limit)</li>
    <li>Process gases containing fluorine compounds completely captured by specialized filtration system</li>
    <li>Resulting biochar free from PFAS contamination and safe for soil application</li>
  </ul>
