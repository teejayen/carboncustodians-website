        <h2>The Disaster Recovery Challenge</h2>
        <p>Natural disasters and environmental emergencies create enormous volumes of waste that overwhelm existing management systems. This debris often contains valuable materials that could aid recovery, but conventional approaches treat it simply as waste requiring disposal.</p>
        <p>In Australia alone, the 2019-2020 bushfires generated over 1.8 million tonnes of debris and damaged timber, while the 2022 floods created hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste requiring urgent management.</p>
        <p>Traditional disaster waste management approaches rely on landfilling or mass burning, losing valuable resources while creating additional environmental impacts during a critical recovery period.</p>

      <h3>Research Highlight: Biochar in Post-Disaster Soil Restoration</h3>
      <p>Research from the Environmental Remediation Institute demonstrated that biochar created from disaster debris can provide significant benefits for affected landscapes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced soil erosion by 40-60% on slopes and fire-affected areas</li>
        <li>Improved water infiltration by 30-50% in compacted and hydrophobic soils</li>
        <li>Enhanced revegetation success rates by 25-45% in challenging conditions</li>
        <li>Immobilised heavy metals and certain contaminants by 50-90% in flood-affected soils</li>
        <li>Created carbon-negative outcomes from disaster materials that would otherwise release additional greenhouse gases</li>

      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Solving the Treated Timber Challenge</h2>
        <p>One of the most significant challenges in disaster recovery is the safe management of treated timber from damaged structures. Our technology addresses this critical need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Safe Processing:</strong> Our high-temperature pyrolysis system (650°C+) can effectively immobilise up to 98% of copper, chromium, and arsenic from CCA-treated timber</li>
          <li><strong>Contaminant Destruction:</strong> The process destroys organic preservatives including creosote, pentachlorophenol, and ACQ</li>
          <li><strong>Leaching Prevention:</strong> The resulting material meets EPA leachability standards, converting a hazardous waste into a safe resource</li>
          <li><strong>Volume Reduction:</strong> Processing reduces material volume by 50-80%, dramatically improving logistics and transportation efficiency</li>
          <li><strong>Safe Applications:</strong> Processed materials can be safely used in construction materials, road base, and industrial applications for rebuilding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This capability fills a critical gap in disaster response where treated timber often represents one of the most challenging waste streams requiring specialised handling and disposal.</p>

    <div class="case-study">
      <h3>Theoretical Application: Bushfire Recovery Program</h3>
      <p>Based on pyrolysis technology capabilities and research data, a regional bushfire recovery program could potentially achieve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processing of 20,000+ tonnes of burned timber and vegetation debris within 6 months</li>
        <li>Production of approximately 5,000 tonnes of specialised biochar tailored for land restoration</li>
        <li>Soil application supporting accelerated revegetation and erosion control on fire-affected landscapes</li>
        <li>Creation of biochar-enhanced building materials for reconstruction efforts</li>
        <li>Potential carbon credit generation representing approximately 18,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent</li>
        <li>Estimated 70-80% reduction in landfill requirements for organic disaster debris</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note: This represents a theoretical application based on system capabilities and research data. The specific outcomes would depend on the scale of disaster, material composition, and implementation details.</em></p>
